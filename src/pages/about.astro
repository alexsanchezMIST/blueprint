        <h2>About Jeff Perry</h2>
        <p>
          As a software, mechanical, and manufacturing engineer, I designed and
          developed a lot of products and processes.
        </p>
        <p>Now I build people.</p>
        <p>
          This is where my joy and professional satisfaction comes fromâ€”being a
          part of helping others succeed and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every person is unique and has different challenges. I can't solve
          every problem, but have been able to assist people in many ways
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Finding increased user career.</strong> The grass is not always
            greener on the other side, but sometimes it is. We can explore the "stay
            or go" question and help you be in a better spot to succeed either way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dealing with unemployment or underemployment.</strong> You are
            a solid professional with skills to bring to the table that aren't being
            put to use. Let's change that together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Getting clarity and exploring new career possibilities.
            </strong> Engineers are versatile and have many directions they could
            take their careers. Let's get clear on what's truly important to you
            so you can create a career you love.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leadership and personal development.</strong> Starting from a
            foundation of mindsets, we can work together to change how you see yourself
            and the people around you, building critical leadership skills along
            the way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For years, I have had the pleasure of supporting engineers and
          software pros from new grads to executives. Having been on the front
          lines in the technical world, I have been able to map out the
          necessary skills for becoming a quality leader in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you work with me as your coach, you work with someone who has
          been where you are, and has the skills to get you where you want to
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to learn about you and the challenges you face. Please
